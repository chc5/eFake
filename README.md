## A prototype for an online e-commerce website that sells tech products

This website was my final project for my Web Development class in high school. I built this website purely on vanilla PHP5 back in 2015.

## What I have learned from this project
- PHP5
- WAMP stack
- Regular Expression
- Cookies and Sessions

## What I have accomplished from this project
- Used Regular Expressions to restrict usernames and passwords and prevent SQL injections.
- Retrieved images and data from MySQL and displaying the queries on the website.
- Used Cookies and Sessions to maintain user's status to see if they are logged in or not.
- Deployed this website online.
